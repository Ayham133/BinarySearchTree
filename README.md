# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Java. A binary search tree is a data structure that maintains a sorted order of elements, allowing efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

## Features
- Insertion of nodes into the tree
- Search for a node in the tree
- Deletion of nodes from the tree
- Traversals: In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order
- Supports both recursive and iterative methods (if applicable)
- Handles cases of nodes with zero, one, or two children during deletion

## Introduction

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree in which each node has at most two children, and the left child's value is always less than the parent's value, while the right child's value is always greater. This property makes BSTs efficient for searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

## How it Works

In this implementation:
- **Insertion**: Adds a node while maintaining the BST property.
- **Search**: Finds a node based on its value.
- **Deletion**: Removes a node, adjusting the tree as needed to maintain the BST property.
- **Traversal**: Provides methods for traversing the tree in different orders (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

## Getting Started

To use this Binary Search Tree implementation, you need Java installed on your machine. You can download Java from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher.
- A text editor or IDE for writing Java code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayham133/BinarySearchTree.git
